        <h1>Vegetation Density is a Sign of Climate Change</h1>
        <h2>People normally look to temperature changes, glaciers, and ocean levels for signs of climate change <br>
          but there is something else that reacts much faster to effects of climate change...
        </h2>

      <div class="page">
          <h2>For each year, vegetation density changes with the season.</h2>
          <p>Greenness peaks in the central region of the United States during the summer, drops in fall, and plateus in winter, before slowly reviving in spring. <br> 
            At first this is what we expect, but the truth is complicated...</p>

      <div class="page">
        <h2>In a perfect world, the vegetation density would remain relatively stable every year <br>
        and there would be minimal difference in vegetation density</h2>
        <p>... but because climate change affects the seasons, there is a visible difference in vegetation density between years. But is this really the case?</p>

        <p>The above is the change in density (normalized vegetation) between the summer of 2023 and 2024. <br>
          For reference, the greatest possible absolute change is 2. In this case, we see a noticeable decline in vegetation.</p>

      <div class="page">
        <h2>During the summer months, the vegetation density has been volatile</h2>
        <p>because of droughts and elevated levels of CO2. But as efforts to combat climate change have started to take effect <br>
          the vegetation density has dropped and remained relatively stable
