        <h1>Vegetation Density is a Sign of Climate Change</h1>
        <h2>People normally look to temperature changes, glaciers, and ocean levels for signs of climate change <br>
          but there is something else that reacts much faster to effects of climate change...
        </h2>

          <h2>For each year, vegetation density changes with the season.</h2>
          <p>Greenness peaks in the central region of the United States during the summer, drops in fall, and plateus in winter, before slowly reviving in spring. <br> 
            At first this is what we expect, but the truth is complicated...</p>

        <p>... but because climate change affects the seasons, there is a visible difference in vegetation density between years. But is this really the case?

        <p>The reason the vegetation density is this volatile is due to a combination of droughts and elevated levels of CO2. <br>
          Droughts is obvious, less water means plants will slowly start wilt and eventually die, but CO2 is not as obvious as you may think. <br>
          CO2 is a necessary component to photosynthesis, meaning more CO2 would lead to more photosynthesis and more plants right? <br>
          Not quite. Although more CO2 does generally have a positive effect on plants, plants are limited by other nutrients they have to compete for. <br>
          It is also a greenhouse gas, which also feeds into increased temperatures and droughts, leading to volatile vegetation density.
