        <h1>Vegetation Density is a Sign of Climate Change</h1>
        <h2>People normally look to temperature changes, glaciers, and ocean levels for signs of climate change <br>
          but there is something else that reacts much faster to effects of climate change...
        </h2>

      <div class="page">
          <h2>For each year, vegetation density changes with the season</h2>
          <p>with the vegetation being the most dense in the summer, least dense in the winter, <br>
            and transitioning in spring and fall</p>

      <div class="page">
        <h2>In a perfect world, the vegetation density would stay relatively stable for every year <br>
        and there would be minimal difference in vegetation density</h2>
        <p>...but because of climate change affecting the seasons there is a visible difference in vegetation density between years.</p>
