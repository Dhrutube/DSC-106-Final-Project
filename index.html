              Select any two years such that the range between them is 5 years. Each colored line corresponds to a year, showing the trend of vegetation over the year in the U.S. overall. The x-axis represents the months, and the y-axis represents the density of current vegetation over the U.S.

        <h2>What have we done so far?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>We chose NASA MODIS as our dataset and have finished most of our EDA.</li>
          <li>We have compiled the data we are planning to use into .csv files, pulled from the .xml file acquired from the dataset.</li>
          <li>We have started working on creating appropriate sized bins of vegetation density for the final visualization on a map and ways to plot it.</li>
          <li>We are working on making our final presentation a more 'story-telling' format, experimenting with multiple map visualizations, etc.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>As of right now, we believe the most challenging part to design would be a good story-telling format.</li>
          <li>While we are currently experimenting on ways to do this, but since there are so many options, it is tough to decide on a final one.</li>
          <li>So far, we have experimented with just one map combined with a line plot, only a map, a slideshow format like the gun deaths story-telling visualization covered in lecture, and even multiple maps for each year, each map showing the vegetation for each season.</li>
          <li>For the visualization where we would show multiple maps for each season, experimenting with the number of bins gets tougher, since we want to show differences but not make them too exaggerated.</li>
          <li>For the other visualizations, coming up with an 'and-therfore' is okay, but coming up with a 'but' part of the story is somewhat difficult.</li>
          <li>Also, while for now, we are only showing five years, we might look into methods that can show more than 5 years yet still not be cluttered.</li>
        </ol>
